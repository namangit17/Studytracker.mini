# Project Statement: Study Planner & To‑Do Manager

## Problem Statement

Students often struggle to manage academic tasks and track effective
study time. They require a simple system that allows them to list tasks,
delete tasks, and monitor the time spent studying different subjects.
The absence of a unified tool leads to poor productivity, missed
deadlines, and inaccurate tracking of study habits.

## Scope of the Project

This project provides: - A To‑Do list manager for adding, viewing, and
deleting tasks. - A Study Timer module to track the duration spent on
any subject. - A Time Log viewer that displays all recorded study
sessions.

The project is implemented using Python and runs on a CLI‑based
interface.

## Target Users

-   Students preparing for exams.
-   Individuals who prefer simple task tracking.
-   Anyone who wants to monitor time spent on focused work
    (Pomodoro‑style).
